# About Cupboard Tools
The goal of this project is to complement [Cupboard][1] with common and useful tools, without messing too much
with the core project.
Currently it consists of a [ContentProvider][2] and a [Helper for Uris][3] and some [converters][4].

## Repository

The repository is hosted on [Bintray][5]. 

Obviously documentation is lacking at the moment, but feedback is welcome.
